## About

I have done this Frontend Mentor exercise to familiarize myself with the process of making challenges and to play/practice with sass üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I used flexbox to position some parts of the component as I thought it was more suitable than grid and I know it better.

The measures are a bit by eye because I have not used the premium function with the figma design and I had to rely on a png.
